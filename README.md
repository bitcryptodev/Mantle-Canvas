# Mantle-Canvas

**Mantle-Canvas** is a decentralized platform that empowers users to collaboratively create vibrant pixel art on a 64x64 canvas. Participants can paint individual pixels or upload entire images, utilizing **PaintTokens**—an ERC20-based cryptocurrency—to purchase and set pixel colors. The system leverages smart contracts deployed on the **Mantle Sepolia**  to manage token transactions and ensure secure, ownership-based modifications of the canvas. This seamless integration of blockchain technology fosters a community-driven art experience, allowing anyone to contribute to and own a piece of the collective masterpiece.

You can access the Dapp right now at [https://mantle-canvas.vercel.app/](https://mantle-canvas.vercel.app/)
